# Initial setup

You can refer to (this link)[https://supabase.com/docs/guides/deployment/managing-environments] to help setting up this project locally, but since there are many steps there that must be done only once, here's the setup you need to run this ongoing project locally:

- Make sure Docker is installed and running
- Run these two commands:

```bash
supabase login
supabase supabase start
```
